I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at [CMU MCS](https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/), studying [Computational Neuroscience](https://brain.andrew.cmu.edu/home). Interested in using machine learning to understand cognitive and/or biological systems. At CMU, I am part of the [Cognitive and Social Development Lab](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/csdl/home), advised by [Dr. Catarina Vales](https://cvales.weebly.com/), working on a statistics in language project in order to understand how children extract local and global word co-occurances in conversational + textual inputs. This recent summer of 2024, I interned at the [UCLA California Nanosystems Institute](https://cnsi.ucla.edu/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Robert Damoiseaux](https://pharmacology.ucla.edu/people/robert-damoiseaux) and [Dr. David Ulmert](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/h-david-ulmert/) to program a LLM-based pipeline for vocal command processing on lab automation. I also conducted a [cell painting](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.105) assay and high throughput screening data analysis on cancer cell lines. Before that, I worked at the [CAOs lab](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/caoslab/), advised by [Dr. Brad Mahon](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/mahon-brad.html) and Emefa Akwayena, to help run an in-person Perceptual Balance Behavioral study on participants to investigate how the brain stores, manipulates and uses object knowledge. In high school, I was a research assistant, mentored by [Dr.Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/), where I was introduced to (and inspired by) research on determining whether a brain region is more dedicated to processing visual or semantic features of words, based on fMRI data.
